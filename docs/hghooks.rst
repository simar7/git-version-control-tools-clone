Mercurial Hooks
===============

The ``hghooks`` directory contains a number of Mercurial hooks used by
Mozilla projects.

The content of this directory originally derived from its own
repository. Changesets ``e11fee681380`` through ``1f927bcba52c`` contain
the import of this repository.

This directory has its origins in the operation of the Mercurial server
at Mozilla. It is an eventual goal to restructure the hooks to be usable
on both client and server.
