# This script supplements ``hghave`` from Mercurial testing environment to
# support requirements specific to Mozilla. Some of the tests should
# arguably be added upstream. Until then, this file and the hacks around it
# exist.

# The way Mercurial's test runner processes ``#require`` directives is that
# it invokes an ``hghave`` script in the same directory as the test.
# This repository has numerous ``hghave`` scripts scattered about in
# directories containing tests that use ``#require``. Those scripts simply
# find this file and ``execfile()`` it (effectively doing a #include).
# Hacky, but it works.
