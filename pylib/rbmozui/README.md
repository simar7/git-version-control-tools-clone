# Mozilla UI tweaks for Review Board

This is a Review Board extension that makes Mozilla-specific tweaks to the user interface. This extension hides parts of the UI we don't need, adds parts that we do need, and will eventually reskin it to be more "Mozilla-y".

## Installation instructions

Finally, log in to Review Board's administrator interface, and choose "Extensions" at the top of the page. You should see "rbmozui" listed as an available extension. Click on "Enable", and you should be all set!
