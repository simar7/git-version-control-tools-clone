"""work with Firefox source repositories more easily.

The Firefox source repository is a collection of multiple repositories
all stemming from the same root commit. They can effectively be modeled
as a single, unified repository with multiple heads. This extension
facilitates doing that.

Remote Tracking Tags
====================

When you pull from a known Firefox repository, this extension will
automatically create a local-only tag corresponding to the name of
the remote repository.

For example, when you pull from https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central,
the ``central`` tag will be created. You can then update to the last
pull mozilla-central changeset by running ``hg up central``.

These local tags are read only. If you update to a tag and commit, the
tag will not move forward.

Servers can optionally enable serving these tags by setting
``firefoxtree.servetags`` to True. When clients perform a pull, they will
download and apply these tags automatically.

Pre-defined Repository Paths
============================

Instead of defining URLs of Firefox repositories in your .hg/hgrc, the
extension defines them for you.

You can run `hg pull central` or `hg pull inbound` and the alias
automatically gets resolved to the appropriate URL.

Safer Push Defaults
===================

The default behavior of `hg push` is to transfer all non-remote changesets
to the remote. For people with a head/bookmark-based workflow, this is
extremely annoying, as you'll perform the push only to have a hook on a
server reject it because you are pushing multiple heads.

This extension changes the default behavior of `hg push` to only push
'.' (the commit of the working copy) by default when pushing to a
Firefox repo.

This extension also prevents pushing of multiple heads to known Firefox
repos (the server would reject the multi-headed push anyway).

fxheads Command
===============

The `hg fxheads` command is a variation of `hg heads` that prints a concise
list of the last-known commits for the Firefox repositories.
