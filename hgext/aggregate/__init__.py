"""Aggregate multiple Mercurial repositories into a local repository.

This extension is used to aggregate (pull) the contents of multiple
remotes into a local repository. It is essentially a glorified wrapper
around invoking ``hg pull`` multiple times.

Avoiding Excessive Locking
==========================

By default, Mercurial will hold a lock around the entire ``pull()`` operation.
This includes discovery, which may be time-consuming.

This extension changes behavior such that discovery occurs outside of the lock
and no lock is taken if there are no incoming changesets.
